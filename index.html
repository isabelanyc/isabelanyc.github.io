        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi, I'm Isabela! I'm a data scientist hailing from the streets of Queens, New York. Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by the world of computers. Since I was five years old, if something had a battery or a display on it, you could bet I was going to take it apart. As a kid, I learned that the only way to understand how something works is to get your hands dirty, take things apart, and see all the gears and windings for yourself.
                Fast forward a few years, and it should come as no surprise that I pursued my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at RIT. Throughout my undergrad, I was convinced I was going to become a hardware engineer. That is until I took an introductory class in stochastic processes. I was never too much of a math whiz, but when I realized that I could use data to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the world works and basically become a fortune teller, I was sold. Okay, so maybe that isn't exactly how data science works, but at that time, I understood it as: lots of data = lots of insights = expanding global knowledge = pretty good predictions about the future.
                Anyways, I decided to go to grad school to study Data Science, and my primary area of focus was in NLP. Nowadays, I work as a Data Science consultant and mess around with LLMs. That said, I have also been diving into the intriguing field of AI safety, exploring ways to make artificial intelligence more robust and reliable. Every now and then, I go back to my electrical roots. I still love to dabble in embedded systems, microcontroller projects, and tinkering with Raspberry Pi.

                When I'm not geeking out over code or worrying about the AI apocalypse, you'll find me playing guitar, watching FC Barcelona, or complaining about another terrible season for the Knicks. I also love to travel and feel very fortunate to have experienced diverse cultures and landscapes.
    
                Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch. I'm always open to collaboration and making new friends.
    
                I've made adjustments to improve the flow and grammar. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to change or add!
