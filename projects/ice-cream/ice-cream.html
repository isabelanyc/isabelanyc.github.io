            The Ice Cream Reviews project is an NLP project that aims to classify reviews as either being good or bad.
            Sentiment analysis is a fine a technique to use here, but this project doesn't actually use the sentiment ratings as part of the model input (though a sentiment analysis is done in the EDA notebook).
            The reason I don't use sentiment analysis directly is because when I started this project back in 2021, I was just starting my data science journey and had no idea what I was doing (spoiler alert, I still don't) and I decided to .
            The classification of good/bad comes from the star rating of each review. If a review is 4 stars and over, it is considered good. Otherwise, its a bad review.
