# Personal Portfolio Website
[Personal website](https://isabelanyc.github.io/index.html)
This is my personal portfolio website. The website is built using HTML, CSS and a tiny amount of JavaScript. I am not a professional web developer, so I relied heavily on ChatGPT to pull this off. I also used [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/) for the project images because I'm not a graphic designer either.
